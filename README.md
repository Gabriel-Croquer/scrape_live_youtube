# scrape_live_youtube

In a report I did for my company, I started to investigate the authomatization of comments in YouTube lives and videos promoting an online slot machine called "Fortune Tiger", a game causing addiction in thousands of people — some of them very poor, believing the game could guarantee them easy money, but in reality it drains the few money these people have.   

In this piece, I will dive into data scraping and analysis of this comments (something it wasn't possibile to do in the first report) to demonstrate how they are repeated over and over in the lives that could last dozens of hours or even days. Instead of live broadcasts, these lives are, in fact, repetitions of the same recorded content for hours on end.

The content is always the same: a presenter says he found a flaw that allows him to win a lot of money in supposed new versions of Fortune Tiger, the official name of the tiger game. In one case, the presenter says he earned the equivalent of 8 salaries in half an hour. Of course, it is a lie. 

The problem is people that search for "Fortune Tiger" to check if the game is true or not end up seeing multiple positive comments from the bots. It makes people believe that other real people have made money on the platform. 

In one of this lives I found this wednesday  (3), I scraped 500 comments in  15 minutes. In this period, the message "this platform is very good" appeared 22 times, posted by 9 two different accounts, and 29 authors published comments.

I scraped the live again, and reached to 500 new comments. But they weren't actually new. They were also repeated as hell.

Ok... So we have robots commenting on lives. 

But something crazy I noticed when looking at commentaries on very popular footbal videos -- not lives actually published videos -- is that there seem to be bots liking like and commenting  another comment, that says: "How to do 100 to 1000 a day!!!!", and, further in the replies, links to the "Fortune Tiger" fraud.

But now, again, I scraped the replies from comments in the video and found a lot of botish answers.

There was a "fella", profile named "margo2308", that actually wrote 233 replies. Is he someone who likes to debate a lot on footbal videos? No, he's just another bot passing by, and replying a lot to inflate the scammer comments.
